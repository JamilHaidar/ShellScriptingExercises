# Scripting Exercises

This repository includes exercises from my scripting course where I implement scripts that run in the terminal. The scripts I implemnted are either terminal tools or scripts that do a huge amount of data processing and filtering in very efficient ways.

The languages used are Shell scripts (sh, bash, zsh), Python, Perl.

I utilize advanced regular expressions (regex) as well as concatinating Linux commands and techniques such as piping, sed, grep, awk, etc.
