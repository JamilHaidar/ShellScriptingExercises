# ShellScriptingExercises

This repository includes exercises from my scripting course where I implement scripts that run in the terminal.

The languages used are Shell (sh, bash, zsh), Python, Perl.

I utilize advanced regular expressions (regex) as well as concatinating Linux commands and techniques such as piping, sed, grep, awk, etc.
